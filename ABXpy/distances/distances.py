    Heuristic: each process should have approximately

            attributed the biggest remaining block

This function can be used concurrently by several processes.
When it is the case synchronization of the writing operations in
the target distance_file is required by HDF5.
The current solution uses a global lock for the whole file.
Since each job is writing in different places, it should in principle be
possible to do all the write concurrently if ever necessary, using parallel
