The "feature" dimension is along the columns and the "time" dimension
along the lines of arrays x and y.

The function do not verify its arguments, common problems are:
    shape of one array is n instead of (n,1)
    an array is not of the correct type DTYPE_t
    the feature dimension of the two array do not match
    the feature and time dimension are exchanged
    the dist_array is not of the correct size or type
