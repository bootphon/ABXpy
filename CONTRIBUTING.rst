Contributing
============

If you discover issues, have ideas for improvements or new features,
or want to contribute a new module, please report them to the `issue
tracker`_ of the repository or submit a pull request. Please, try to
follow these guidelines when you do so.

Issue reporting
===============

* Check that the issue has not already been reported or fixed in the
  latest code (a.k.a. `master`).
* Include any relevant code to the issue summary, when possible write
  a broken test case.

Pull requests
=============  

* Read how to properly contribute to open source projects on Github `here`_.
* Use a topic branch to easily amend a pull request later, if necessary.
* Use the same coding conventions as the rest of the project.
* Open a `pull request`_ that relates to *only* one subject.
